`Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)` and `Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF)` are the services that you can use for creating a decoupled architecture in AWS.

Decoupled architecture is a type of computing architecture that enables computing components or layers to execute independently while still interfacing with each other.

Amazon SQS offers reliable, highly-scalable hosted queues for storing messages while they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS lets you move data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

Amazon SWF is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.
